# cran_histories

Collection of exchanges with CRAN reviewers and maintainer.

Additions from the community are welcomed:

 - +1 if you got a similar experience
 - Open a new issue if this is a different and new history
 - You can also let me know of an interaction via private channels (slack, twitter, email...)

Many thanks to all that contributed!

## Other considerations

 - The name of the maintainer and the CRAN reviewer might be anonymous or not. 
 - The user posting it might be the one involved on the exchange or not.
 - There is no way to verify the content of the records stored here.
 - The nature of this collection will be biased. Most of the hundreds of positive interactions that happen on CRAN won't end up appearing here. 
 - This collection is primary to see if there is some negative experience repeating or a common pattern to them.
