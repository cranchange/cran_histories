# CRAN histories

Collection of exchanges with CRAN reviewers and maintainer.
This collection is primary to see if there are common patterns, both positive and negative.
The nature of this collection will be biased and not representative of the CRAN interactions. 
Most of the hundreds of positive interactions that happen with CRAN members won't end up appearing here. 

Additions from the community are welcomed:

 - +1 if you got a similar experience to the onse listed on [discussions](https://github.com/cranchange/cran_histories/discussions/)
 - Open a new [discussion](https://github.com/cranchange/cran_histories/discussions/new) if this is a different and new history
   -  Add as much relevant context as you can
   -  Disclose if the content is in name of others or you are involved on the experience. 
   -  Choose either the positive or the negative category
 - You can also let me know of an interaction via private channels (slack, twitter, email...)

Many thanks to all that contributed!

## Other considerations

 - The name of the maintainer and the CRAN reviewer might be anonymous or not. 
 - The user posting it might be the one involved on the exchange or not. Make it clear in either case. 
 - There is no way to verify the content of the records stored here.
